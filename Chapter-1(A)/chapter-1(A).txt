->What are programming languages?
programming language are the terms given to language through which we can talk to the computer systems. These are devided into two major parts known as:-
a. Low level languages: The term low means close to the Hardware
b. high level languages: the term High means close to the Humans

->Low level languages:
The languages in this category are:
a. machine level language
b. Assembly language

->Machine level language
Since we know computer is an electronic device and it can only understand 0 and 1. so to communicate with computer we need to talk in 0 and 1 and that language is
termed as Machine level language.

->Assembly language
In this language we started to use English based terms like ADD(for Addition),SUB(Subtraction) and MUL(Multiplication). but as we know computer can only understand
0 and 1 so we need someone who can convert these terms into machine understandable form, so the term Assembler(Translator) were introduced.
	
->High level language
High level languages are portable in nature.
Machine Independent
Easy to write
Translators are used to convert high level language into machine understandable form(Compilers or Interpreter).

->Translator
Translators are used to convert high level or low level language into the machine understable form.
eg. Compilers
Interpreter
